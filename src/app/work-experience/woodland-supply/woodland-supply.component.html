        Precision machining was the main priority of what I did here. My job was to create trimming for doors, windows, ceiling edges, and more. 
        There were tight tolerances that had to be maintained for dimensions, and strict quality control for natural wood defects that had to be enforced. 
        In order to maintain these requirements, a high level of training, precise run-time adjustments, and judgement was necessary
        Appropriate cutting tools needed to be selected to create the profile required by any order.
        Any small chipping, burning, or cracking had to be sanded and patched, while larger defects were unsuitable for shipping, and had to be discarded.
