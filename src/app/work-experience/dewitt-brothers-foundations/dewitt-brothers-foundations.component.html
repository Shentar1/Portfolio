    <p id="workDescription">
        This job included quite a bit of hefty work. Most of my work revolved around lifting and carrying, positioning concrete forms that would later
        contain the poured concrete, tying steel in between those forms to reinforce the afore mentioned concrete, and ensuring the resulting walls were
        straight, level, and smooth. To help with this, and for the benefit of the framers afterward, a wood topping, called a "ladderbox", 
        was set into the concrete during pouring. Weather played a large role in how this process worked out, and sometimes we would have to delay work in one 
        area to pump water out, and I really had to dress for the cold weather.
        Afterwards, lower beam pockets were affixed to the wall with concrete anchors for basements with a wood floor, and we would place these beams, 
        the upper beams for the main floor, and the teleposts that would support this upper beam
